    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Data Encodeing is the process of converting categorical or textual data into a numerical format that machine learning models can understand. It is essential because most ML algorithims work with number , not text."

    "Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Nominal encoding is a technique used to convert categorical data into numerical form when the categories have no inherent  order (nominal data).This is typically done using one hot encoding or label encoding \n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE \n",
    "\n",
    "In a retail dataset, \"the city\" column has value like Delhi ,Mumbai,Chennai. Using Nominal encoding \n",
    "\n",
    "- Label encoding: Delhi = 0 , Mumbai = 1 , Chennai = 2\n",
    "- One hot encoding : Create three binary columns\n",
    "  Delhi:[1,0,0]\n",
    "  Mumbai:[0,1,0]\n",
    "  Chennai:[0,0,1]\n",
    "\n",

    "Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Nominal encoding (e.g., Label Encoding ) is preferred over one hot encoding when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. High Cardinality : The categorical variable has large number of unique categories, and one-hot encoding would create too many columns, increasing memory usage and computational complexity\n",
    "2. Tree-based Model: Algorithims like Decision Trees or Random Forests can handle numerical label- encoded data well without misinterpreting it as ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "PRACTICAL EXAMPLE \n",
    "\n",
    "In a movie recommendation systems, the \"Genere\" column has 100+ unique geners. Using label encoding (e.g., Action=0 ,comedy=1, Drama =2 ,.....)avoids creating 100+ columns, making the data more efficient to process in tree-based models like Random Forest."

    "\n",
    "Ans- For a dataset with 5 unique categories value, One-Hot encoding is preferred \n",
    "\n",
    "REASON:\n",
    "- Avoids Ordinal Misinterpretation: Machine learning models might incorrectly treat label-encoded value (e.g.,0,1,2,..) as having an order\n",
    "- Low Cardinality: With only 5 categories ,the additional columns created by one hot encoding are manageable and won't significantly increases computatinal complexity\n",
